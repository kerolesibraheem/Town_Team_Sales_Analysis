# Town_Team_Sales_Analysis
This project presents sales data from 2019 to 2020 for a clothing company, analyzed using Excel to derive insights on product performance, order types, monthly and yearly trends, and category breakdowns.

I analyzed top-selling items, compared in-store vs. online sales, tracked yearly sales trends, and highlighted category-wise sales distribution to understand customer preferences and product demand.

The goal was to help business stakeholders make informed decisions on inventory management, sales strategy, and channel performance optimization.
